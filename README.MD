🎛️ Remote Media Play/Pause Control (Windows)
This script enables remote control of media playback on a Windows machine through a WebSocket connection.

The script listens for control messages from a WebSocket server. When it receives a message like resume,5, it simulates a Play/Pause media key press, waits for the specified duration (e.g., 5 minutes), and then toggles media again to pause. It effectively lets you remotely trigger media playback for a timed interval, useful for alarms, attention signals, or automation.
